                While researching for our project and looking for other experts on the field of synthetic biology, who could give us valuable input for our project progression,
                we came into contact with Prof. Dr. Dörte Rother and Dr. Torsten Sehl from the Biocatalysis Group of the Jülich Research Centre. With their expertise in enzymcatalysis
                we tried to figure out how to engineer our already existing idea of a synthetic mitochondrium based ATP regeneration system to the needs of a modern industrial application.<br><br>

                The first meeting happened in March 2020 and during the progress of our project we kept in close contact with the Team of the Jülich Research Centre. We apprised them on our project
                progression while collecting important hints on how to tailor our project in various aspects. For our project we needed to know how our system could possibly outcompete other already
                existing cofactor regeneration systems (by providing XY?). Additionally, it was important for us to learn whether the sole ATP regeneration has already potential in an industrial field,
                or if there is a more proficient application in already running in vitro systems. In vitro systems for product synthesis are highly complex and therefore knowing what to bear in mind
                while designing something that meets the needs of such a system is crucial. This cooperation led to the chance of us working there on an Enzyme reaction, where an Application of
                a new innovative cofactor regeneration System with the outlook of our Chassis getting tested in a real environment. We want to not only proof that it has the ability to regenerate

              We scheduled a Zoom-Meeting with Prof. Dr. Jochen Büchs from the “Aachener Verfahrenstechnik”, in which we presented our project
              idea M.A.R.S. to get his advice on our bioreactor design. Since we try to enable the various ATP-dependent processes in the biotechnological
              industry to be implemented at a bigger scale, the design of our reactor has special significance. Our reactor must be economically accessible
              and most importantly safe and reliable functionality.<br><br>

              Professor Büchs is one of the leading scientists in bioreactor design, specializing in shake flasks systems and bioreactors. He took the time
              to review our basic concept and provide a vast amount of input and fresh ideas for our system. We faced two major challenges considering our
              bioreactor design. First, we were not sure how to generate sufficient mixing in our reactor, without exerting too much hydrodynamical stress to
              our chassis. On top of that we needed a very specific reactor geometry to be able to incorporate magnets into the design, so that they were close
              enough to reach all magnetic particles inside and also retractable at will, to initiate the magnetic mechanism at different stages of recycling.
              Professor Büchs helped us a lot with both our major challenges and also provided more expertise on fine details and the industrial application.<br><br>

              To spread the idea of iGEM and our project into the world we organized an online meeting with interested students of the ‘Universidad de Costa Rica’.
              Around 40 students of the pharmacy career were present at the meeting. We had the chance to present our project and the idea of iGEM to a different
              audience. After the presentation we had a long discussion with the students. They gave us the chance to see our project in a different way because
              they come from a different field of research. Through their specific questions, which came especially form the medical background, we had the opportunity
              to explain how our M.A.R.S. can help to improve the production of precursors of pharmaceuticals. They gave us a deep understanding of the importance of
              ATP in their field of research. Furthermore, it showed the validation of the importance of our system and that not only in our plan but also in reality our
              system is needed more than before.<br><br>
              Apart from our project itself, we saw the priority of spreading the idea of such a chance to change the world and make it a better place because it
              became very clear that all of them also would appreciate it to be part of an iGEM team and the iGEM competition. At the end of the meeting we got a
              lot of questions concerning the procedure of becoming an iGEM member.<br>

              Through the <a class="myBlue" href="#HP_Rother" style="font-size: 16px">constructive input of Prof. Dr. Rother and Dr. Torsten Sehl</a>, we could receive a better understanding on
              how to power enzymatic reactions and what to consider while
              working with such in Vitro systems. During the first meeting we quickly noticed, that for an industrial application it is significally more interesting to implement our system
              in a process in which continuously cofactor regeneration is performed instead of using our system to purely produce ATP. As a consequence, we adapted our title to the Term
              “Magnetic ATP Recycling System”. Reusing the deplenished ADP over and over in a reaction system instead of adding a specific amount provides flexibility and saves resources.<br><br>
              The term “recycling” became even more prominent during our Meetings, since we came to the conclusion, that reusability might be an aspect which could uplift our ATP-Regeneration
              System from other methods to synthezise ATP. Consequently, we came to the conclusion that if we engineer the ability to be magnetically retainable into M.A.R.S, a Bioreactor with
              magnetic elements could provide that desiBlue reusability. The Vision to power an in vitro enzyme reaction, extracting the synthesized Products while holding our ATP-Factories back
              in the reactionvessel to convert new substrates into the wanted product, was determined due to this cooperation with the Jülich Research Centre. Furthermore, we realized how
              abundant the ATP use is for enzyme reactions. HundBlues of pharmaceutical products or fine chemicals require ATP for their enzymatic production. Seeing some of the enzymes such
              as carboxylate Blueuctases or carboligases in action, made us realize the urgency of ATP-Regeneration in todays field of industry even more.

              Thanks to the <a href="#HP_Buechs" style="font-size: 16px" class="myBlue"><b>detailed advice Professor Büchs provided</b></a> for the concept of our bioreactor, we were able to rethink our working process and get a different perspective. Our ideal
              bioreactor would be a continuous system, which can be connected to any process to recycle ATP effectively. For proof of concept for our system, the continuous flow poses a
              lot of challenges, especially because we first need demonstration of our chassis in smaller quantities, to make experiments and try different system set-ups. We early on had
              the vision to make the production of our M.A.R.S. prototype reactor as easy as possible, to enable our system to have the wanted accessibility and easy handling. We came up with
              the idea to 3D print some of the structures and materials we wanted to incorporate. After the meeting with Professor Büchs, we rethought the layout of our prototype, relying on a
              batch reaction system, which can be used repeatedly by quickly altering the reaction medium rather than having it flow continuously. Professor Büchs gave us the idea to split up
              the continuous flow into several smaller batch reactions, to achieve the best results. To get the best combination of mixing and low hydromechanical stress, we opted for a shake
              flask version of our system on a self-printed base, which provides the power input to our system and also incorporates our magnetic mechanism, which can be turned on and off at
              will, by being moved under the reactor base or being retracted from underneath it. All design details are shown on our “Hardware” page. This layout enables us to feed medium onto
              our system in the shake flasks and pumping the recycled ATP-rich medium out at the top, while the magnets keep our chassis in the reactor. Applying the insights and opinions
              Professor Büchs gave us, we were assuBlue that our system can have a big impact on the industrial level and furthermore we were able to steer our project into a much more thought
              out and reliable direction of design, to ensure safety and quality in its application.

              Dr. Platzman noticeably <a class="myBlue" style="font-size: 16px" href="#HP_Platzman">helped us in refining our experiment procedures</a>. First of all, we tried to find a solution
              to quantify our liposome creation in a more effective way. Therefore, a method which could provide visible liposomes in higher amounts would improve for chance for successful ATP
              synthetization. During our meeting, Dr. Platzmann taught us a very efficient shaking method which acts complementary to our current used film rehydration method. Another big challenge
              is the proteinintegration. The concept of implementing proteins into a membrane artificially is nowhere near trivial and therefore we were very glad to get an expert opinion to our
              current procedures. Verifying that our approach is going into the right direction and fine tuning the procedures with the practical knowledge of Dr. Platzmann lead us on a promising
              path for the final two months of laboratory work.
