              Our Human Practices’ function can be instrumental in creating a culture of sustainability and environmental stewardship. Only through close work with different people of different levels of scientific knowledge,
              we can enlighten the world’s problems and discuss their solutions.
              This is necessary for implementing the rapid development of our project. Here, numerous examples demonstrate how a focus on each piece of advice has helped us shape M.A.R.S as it exists today.<br><br>

                While researching for our project and looking for other experts on the field of synthetic biology, who could give us valuable input for our project progression,
                we came into contact with Prof. Dr. Dörte Rother and Dr. Torsten Sehl from the Biocatalysis Group of the Jülich Research Centre. With their expertise in enzymcatalysis
                we tried to figure out how to engineer our already existing idea of a synthetic mitochondrium based ATP regeneration system to the needs of a modern industrial application.<br><br>
                The first meeting happened in March 2020 and during the progress of our project we kept in close contact with the Team of the Jülich Research Centre. We apprised them on our project
                progression while collecting important hints on how to tailor our project in various aspects. For our project we needed to know how our system could possibly outcompete other already
                existing cofactor regeneration systems (by providing XY?). Additionally, it was important for us to learn whether the sole ATP regeneration has already potential in an industrial field,
                or if there is a more proficient application in already running in vitro systems. In vitro systems for product synthesis are highly complex and therefore knowing what to bear in mind
                while designing something that meets the needs of such a system is crucial. This cooperation led to the chance of us working there on an Enzyme reaction, where an Application of
                a new innovative cofactor regeneration System with the outlook of our Chassis getting tested in a real environment. We want to not only proof that it has the ability to regenerate

              We scheduled a Zoom-Meeting with Prof. Dr. Jochen Büchs from the “Aachener Verfahrenstechnik”, in which we presented our project
              idea M.A.R.S. to get his advice on our bioreactor design. Since we try to enable the various ATP-dependent processes in the biotechnological
              industry to be implemented at a bigger scale, the design of our reactor has special significance. Our reactor must be economically accessible
              and most importantly safe and reliable functionality.<br><br>

              Professor Büchs is one of the leading scientists in bioreactor design, specializing in shake flasks systems and bioreactors. He took the time
              to review our basic concept and provide a vast amount of input and fresh ideas for our system. We faced two major challenges considering our
              bioreactor design. First, we were not sure how to generate sufficient mixing in our reactor, without exerting too much hydrodynamical stress to
              our chassis. On top of that we needed a very specific reactor geometry to be able to incorporate magnets into the design, so that they were close
              enough to reach all magnetic particles inside and also retractable at will, to initiate the magnetic mechanism at different stages of recycling.
              Professor Büchs helped us a lot with both our major challenges and also provided more expertise on fine details and the industrial application.<br><br>

                We presented him with our project idea as well as the progress we made so far. Moreover, we wanted to troubleshoot our current procedures and evaluate with him, whether our current experiment schedule was
                created in a reasonable way. Through this meeting we aimed to improve our understanding on protein integration techniques and which lipids support the integration of our chosen proteins. Additionally, he
                presented an easier and more reproducible method for the generation of  giant unilamelar liposomes, which are easier to detect with a fluorescence microscope. Furthermore, we were very thankful, that Dr.
                Platzman was available for further questions via e-mail and scheduled another zoom meeting for that purpose.<br><br>

              We always wondered how do people get a Nobel Prize? What kind of mind do they have? What is their secret to success?<br><br>
              We got our answers. And those answers came from the Nobel laureate himself, Sir John E. Walker. He received his Nobel Prize in chemistry (1997) for his ground-breaking work about the ATP-Synthase.
              Because of his vast knowledge on this topic and since our project is closely related to his research field, we organized an online meeting with him. In the meeting, he was able to provide information
              about ATP synthase and, most valuably, the function and utilization of an inhibitor protein (IF1). This protein is crucial for projects, such as M.A.R.S., where the inhibition of ATP hydrolysis plays
              a key role in keeping the system running.<br><br>
              Some random events in his life brought him to one of humanity's significant achievements, namely the Nobel Prize. He met Professor Frederick Sanger at a workshop at the University of Cambridge.
              He was later invited to work at the Laboratory of Molecular Biology of the Medical Research Council, where he continues his research on the ATP synthase. We appreciate his interest in communicating
              with us and the constructive discussion about our project.<br><br>
              Finally, we are heavily inspired by this meeting and honestly believe in a positive impact for young scientists to discuss with people who achieved enormous scientific results.<br>

              For the production of the liposomes according to the paper of Göpfrich et al. (2019) <a style="color: #eaeaea" href="#ref"><b>[1]</b></a>, we ordered the oil “Krytox™” as a surfactant in the oily phase. The marketing department of the
              manufacturing and sales company Costenoble then contacted us to find out more about our use of their product in a biotechnological context. At the personal meeting, we presented our
              project M.A.R.S. with a focus on the formation of liposomes. We then answered numerous questions from Costenoble regarding the relevance of liposome formation and production for biotechnology
              and synthetic biology. Finally, we received an overview of the company’s history, as well as its products and their application, which resulted in further interesting considerations

              Through the <a class="myBlue" href="#HP_Rother" style="font-size: 16px">constructive input of Prof. Dr. Rother and Dr. Torsten Sehl</a>, we could receive a better understanding on
              how to power enzymatic reactions and what to consider while
              working with such in Vitro systems. During the first meeting we quickly noticed, that for an industrial application it is significally more interesting to implement our system
              in a process in which continuously cofactor regeneration is performed instead of using our system to purely produce ATP. As a consequence, we adapted our title to the Term
              “Magnetic ATP Recycling System”. Reusing the deplenished ADP over and over in a reaction system instead of adding a specific amount provides flexibility and saves resources.<br><br>
              The term “recycling” became even more prominent during our Meetings, since we came to the conclusion, that reusability might be an aspect which could uplift our ATP-Regeneration
              System from other methods to synthezise ATP. Consequently, we came to the conclusion that if we engineer the ability to be magnetically retainable into M.A.R.S, a Bioreactor with
              magnetic elements could provide that desiBlue reusability. The Vision to power an in vitro enzyme reaction, extracting the synthesized Products while holding our ATP-Factories back
              in the reactionvessel to convert new substrates into the wanted product, was determined due to this cooperation with the Jülich Research Centre. Furthermore, we realized how
              abundant the ATP use is for enzyme reactions. HundBlues of pharmaceutical products or fine chemicals require ATP for their enzymatic production. Seeing some of the enzymes such
              as carboxylate Blueuctases or carboligases in action, made us realize the urgency of ATP-Regeneration in todays field of industry even more.

              lot of challenges, especially because we first need demonstration of our chassis in smaller quantities, to make experiments and try different system set-ups. We early on had
              the vision to make the production of our M.A.R.S. prototype reactor as easy as possible, to enable our system to have the wanted accessibility and easy handling. We came up with
              the idea to 3D print some of the structures and materials we wanted to incorporate. After the meeting with Professor Büchs, we rethought the layout of our prototype, relying on a
              batch reaction system, which can be used repeatedly by quickly altering the reaction medium rather than having it flow continuously. Professor Büchs gave us the idea to split up
              the continuous flow into several smaller batch reactions, to achieve the best results. To get the best combination of mixing and low hydromechanical stress, we opted for a shake
              flask version of our system on a self-printed base, which provides the power input to our system and also incorporates our magnetic mechanism, which can be turned on and off at
              will, by being moved under the reactor base or being retracted from underneath it. All design details are shown on our “Hardware” page. This layout enables us to feed medium onto
              our system in the shake flasks and pumping the recycled ATP-rich medium out at the top, while the magnets keep our chassis in the reactor. Applying the insights and opinions
              Professor Büchs gave us, we were assuBlue that our system can have a big impact on the industrial level and furthermore we were able to steer our project into a much more thought
              out and reliable direction of design, to ensure safety and quality in its application.

              Dr. Platzman noticeably <a class="myBlue" style="font-size: 16px" href="#HP_Platzman">helped us in refining our experiment procedures</a>.  First of all, we tried to find a solution to quantify our liposome
              creation in a more effective way. Therefore, a method which could provide visible liposomes in higher amounts would improve the chance for a successful ATP synthesis. During our meeting, Dr. Platzman taught
              us a very efficient shaking method which acts complementary to our currently used film rehydration method. Another big challenge is the protein integration. The concept of implementing proteins into a membrane
              artificially is nowhere near trivial, therefore we were very fortunate to get an expert opinion on our current procedures. Verifying that our approach is going into the right direction, fine tuning the procedures
              with the practical knowledge of Dr. Platzman lead us on a promising path for the final two months of laboratory work.

              We were part of <a class="myBlue" href="https://2020.igem.org/Team:MSP-Maastricht">iGEM MSP Maastricht’s</a> Proceedings Journal. A journal project in which teams from all over the iGEM community could write and submit articles or introductory papers about their projects, informing each other about their ideas,
              current results, and further plans. We had a great experience writing a short scientific paper about our current laboratory results and methods. Not only did we showcase our project to the other iGEM teams, but we also gave and received
              feedback in a structured peer review process. Reviewing the other teams' articles gave us insight into their projects and the common scientific workflow. The feedback we received for the presentation of our project helped us make our final
              goal more precise, and in general, improve our academic writing skills. The edited journal is available <a class="myBlue" href="https://2020.igem.org/wiki/images/8/89/T--MSP-Maastricht--pdf46.pdf">here</a>.

              To spread the idea of iGEM and our project into the world, we organized an online meeting with interested students of the ‘Universidad de Costa Rica’. Around 40 students of the pharmacy career track attended the meeting.
              We had the chance to present our project and the idea of iGEM to a different audience. After the presentation we had a long discussion with the students. Receiving feedback from an audience, which comes from a different
              field of research, gave us the opportunity to see our project in a new light. Through their specific questions, which came especially form the medical background, we had the opportunity to explain how our M.A.R.S. can
              help to improve the production of pharmaceutical precursors. We benefitted from their deep understanding of the importance of ATP in their field of study. Furthermore, they confirmed the importance of our system and
              that not only in theory but also in reality our system is needed more than ever before.<br><br>
              Apart from feeling it in our project ourselves, we experienced the importance of spreading the iGEM Spirit to others. Taking action in real fields of application sparked a lot of enthusiasm.
              At end of the meeting we received lot of questions concerning the procedure of becoming an iGEM member.<br>
