              Designing is the very first step in every project. Here the idea takes on more and more concrete features. It turns the initial thought in a realisable plan of actions,
              which determines the projectâ€™s direction. This is also why this first step is so important and should be done conscientiously. Choosing every part carefully is
              essential to prevent pitfalls and failures in later stages of the project.

            <div class="textframe_green">Enzyme cascades are the future of production. We cannot afford to continue the energy intensive, polluting and wasteful production of chemicals and pharmaceuticals.<br><br>
              Still enzymes need a very specific energy source to operate: ATP. The only enzyme, that generates ATP in a significant amount is the ATP-Synthase. In vivo it is located in the inner mitochondrial membrane
              in eukaryotes or in the cytoplasmatic membrane of procaryotes. The ATP-Synthase uses a proton gradient and converts an electrochemical potential into chemical energy. The proton gradient is generated by the
              use of high energy electrons by the respiratory chain to pump protons via respiratory complexes from one side of the membrane to the other. Besides the pumping of protons the respiratory complexes 1,3 and
              4 have other tasks needed for keeping a living cell operating. This means to generate ATP and simplify the respiratory process, we need membrane proteins that generate a proton gradient and the ATP-Synthase
              that can utilize the gradient. In other words this system is a minimal mitochondrion.<br><br>
              To generate a proton gradient we did not chose a respiratory complex, but bacteriorhodopsin. Bacteriorhodopsin is a light dependent ion channel and does not require high energy electrons but light energy as
              power source. Integrating these two membrane proteins into a lipid bilayer we are able to generate ATP from ADP and phosphate, just by using light energy, which is the easiest and cleanest energy available.<br><br>
              After figuring out the basic design we wanted to optimize it by making it reusable. Doing so was possible by connecting these powerplants with magnetic particles using anchor peptides. So that after the use of M.A.R.S
              our system can be separated from the product and can be used again.

              The Design of M.A.R.S can be divided into five different branches. The binding tests of our anchor peptides on various surfaces to construct and express an optimal binding complex, liposome formation,
              protein expression, the protein integration of our needed proteins and the activity assays for efficiency comparisons.

            <div class="textframe_blue">
              Concerning the binding tests, we want to use different antimicrobial peptides and test their binding abilities on our polystyrene coated magnetic particles to determine the best one with
              the best binding capacities.  We will then use this one as the magnet-binding domain in our binding complex. To evaluate the binding abilities of the different binding domains, we first
              express different anchor peptides with an eGFP label. We then check the remaining fluorescence under a confocal microscope after several washing steps. To determine the polymersome or
              liposome binding domain we proceed analogously. After finding the best binding peptides, we can express a biadhesive binding complex using both domains and a stiff linker domain to connect
              our ATP factories to our magnetic particles.

            <div class="textframe_blue">
              For the liposome formation we will use the film rehydration technique to rehydrate a dried lipid film and create small unilamellar vesicles. To make the liposomes easier detectable under
              the microscope we want to form giant unilamellar vesicles. This is going to be achieved by creating an oil-surfactant mix, where an aqueous solution, which contains the lipid batch,
              is added <a style="color:#eaeaea !important" href="#ref"><b>[1]</b></a>. The spontaneous formation of surfactant-stabilized water-in-oil droplets with a spherical
              supported lipid bilayer at their periphery is then induced by manual shaking and the average diameter is determined by the shaking duration and intensity. A small amount of ATTO-labelled
              lipids will be included in the lipid batch to confirm the liposome formation using fluorescence microscopy.

              Bacteriorhodopsin will be purified from <i>Halobacterium salinarum</i>. Due to its location in the purple membrane of the microbe, a high yield of purple membrane is desired and is produced under oxygen limited growth conditions.<br><br>
              For the ATP-Synthase we chose <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i> due to easy purification of mitochondria. Furthermore, we decided to use an inhibitor protein called IF1 which binds to the ATP-Synthase and inhibits the ATP
              hydrolysis. Equipt with a His-Tag it also simplifies further purification by using affinity chromatography. The inhibitor protein can be expressed in <i>Escherichia coli</i>.

            <div class="textframe_blue">
              For protein integration, we will start with the integration of bacteriorhodopsin into giant unilamellar vesicles. Therefore, we first solubilize the purple membrane. In order to integrate the membrane proteins, it is necessary
              to destabilize the liposome membrane using the detergence Triton-X 100. We plan to add Triton-X-100 together with our bacteriorhodopsin to the solution and to incubate the mixture to perform the integration. For detergence removal
              we plan to perform multiple washing steps using bio beads. For a confirmation of the correct integration we intended to use pyranine, which is a pH indicating fluorescent dye. Through the acidification of the inner phase of the
              vesicles by bacteriorhodopsin, the pyranine inside the vesicles would appear darker than in their background. Thus, we would be able to visibly proof the correct integration using fluorescent microscopy. The destabilization method
              will also be applied to integrate the ATP synthase and also both proteins simultaneously.

            <div class="textframe_blue">
              For detection and quantification of ATP regeneration multiple tests on a carboxylate reductase from the organism <i>Nocardia otitidiscaviarum</i> will be performed. This enzyme is capable of converting 3-hydroxybenzoic acid to 3-hydroxybenzaldehyde.
              Five different enzyme kinetics will be performed and compared to M.A.R.S. Two negative controls, one without any cofactor related enzymes and one without any source of ATP will be carried out. For actual ATP production we will follow a
              whole cell approach where <i>Escherichia coli</i> is used for 3-hydroxybenzaldehyde production and ATP regeneration. We will use another ATP regeneration system in which carboxylate reductase, 3-hydroxybenzoic acid as the substrate, ATP, NADH,
              polyphosphate and the needed enzyme to perform the conventional ATP regeneration will be combined. Finally, we will compare the results to M.A.R.S and see if an industrial application of M.A.R.S is possible.
