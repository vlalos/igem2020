            To support the work of our wet lab team, we relied heavily on the use of modeling techniques for our complex system. Especially in these times of limited laboratory access, we could greatly profit from the created models and molecular
            dynamics simulation of components, experiments or the whole processes and stoichiometry of M.A.R.S.. On top of that we also used the results of our molecular dynamics simulation to generate visualizing movies of the parts of M.A.R.S..
            <br> We can divide our modeling efforts into two main categories:
            <ul style="font-style: italic;">
              <li>Magnetic ATP Recycling System</li>
              <li>Molecular Dynamics Simulation</li>
            </ul>
            Learn about the basic principles we followed, the details of our simulations as well as our workflows. Especially you will see, how the deep interplay of wet lab experiments, theoretical background knowledge and modeling really improved
            our project.

                To make quantitative predictions of how our system will perform in different setups and environments we created a mathematical model of M.A.R.S. in MatLab using the SimBiology toolbox and following the basic principles of
                computational systems biotechnology. The model is used to show and quantify the ATP-Recycling ability of our system and is furthermore used to establish a connection to a first real-world industrial application our system could be
                used for. This was also tested by the wet lab team at the FZ Jülich. On top of that our model predicted the optimal set of parameters and conditions for operation in vitro, upon which the wet lab team created further experiments.
                Reaction rates for ATP-Synthase and Bacteriorhodopsin were taken from the BioNumbers library. For evaluation of the reaction system at FZ Jülich we approximated the kinetic parameters for the CAR enzyme from values found in scientific
                literature
                <a style="color:#FFFFFF !important" href="#ref"><b>[1]</b></a>.
                The model can be split into four main parts, which we will introduce below. Here are the most important Pools, Parameters, Functions and Equations. The flow and directionality of reactions, which connect the pools, are shown in the
                graphical representation of the model.

                  spherical chassis is a simple function of the average diameter. Other than the chassis diameter, the total number of chassis in the system is a degree of freedom for the model.</span> <br> <br>

                  One of our main disciplines of simulation is molecular dynamics. We used a great variety of different programs and tools to achieve the best possible results for the simulations. Mainly, we used GROMACS, a command line-based program
                  for (in our case) ubuntu subsystems, for simulation of our systems and to generate “.pdb” format files as well as molecular trajectories. These could be loaded into other programs. To visualize our simulations, we at first relied on
                  a trajectory-based solution using VMD, later we transitioned to directly loading our results with UCSF Chimera. Chimera allows us to generate better pictures due to its shadow rendering and multisampling tools and allows us to
                  generate scene-based movies of our resulting all-atom models. Cytoscape helped us to gain further inside into the structure of our proteins and lipid models and took on the role of helping us to understand the modeling processes in
                  the beginning.

                  We first started out learning about the theoretical workflows and how to use the various described programs in March. We started by completing simple protein simulations in water for a few milliseconds and worked our way up to more
                  complex models, as well as membrane integration. We want to acknowledge the freely available tutorials for the GROMACS software by Bevan & Brown Lab. <br> <br>
                  From here on, we came a long way that was full of trial and error, but the further we got, the fewer errors we encountered. Finally, after months of training, we can make use of the endless possibilities and
                  benefits the in-silico modeling software grants us. <br> <br>
                  Our standard GROMACS workflow was integrating and simulating all-atom models from “.pdb” files found on the RCSB Protein Data Bank. For Solvent files we started with standard available water models which we
                  later modified by editing the raw “.pdb” files, e.g. to add and remove ions or solvent molecules for simulation and representation. For our lipid membrane models we used available standard coarse-grain models and modified the lipids
                  to our needs. More information about the phospholipid models can be found below. Please have a look at some simple models we generated of our two main proteins ATP Synthase and Bacteriorhodopsin. Visualization was achieved with
                  different representations in Chimera.

                  How ever, we did not stop at visualizing our components by simulating preexisting models with light changes from the Protein Data Bank. When we first started the modeling process, we had a clear path in mind. We wanted to simulate our system from the bottom up, by first starting with simple models, which we could then integrate into lipid membranes ourselves, adding more and more complexity in every step. The path we envisioned, did not stay as clear at every stage of progress, the main reason for this was a combination of inexperience in the beginning and sensitivity of the used software. By tirelessly trying to find our own errors and misconceptions of the modeling process, we managed to stay on track, although it meant taking several interesting detours. <br><br>
                  <img src="https://2020.igem.org/wiki/images/5/53/T--Aachen--modeling-both.png" alt="" id="atp_br" style="float:left; width:40%; margin-left: 0; shape-outside: circle(50%);">
                  The lipids we simulated were generated by us individually to emulate the lipid batches of the wet lab team. We relied on preexisting coarse-grain models and used Lipid Wrapper to generate lipid models of arbitrary geometry. To achieve the best model possible, we decided to feed the better lipid models with slightly changed parameters back into the lipid wrapper python script. This worked surprisingly well, even though it is not part of the standard workflow. Here we present our two protagonists integrated in a self-generated lipid membrane as described. Visualization was once again achieved with Chimera, which also enabled us to change the dissection of the model in the side view, to enable a better look at ATP Synthase and Bacteriorhodopsin by fading half of the lipid membrane. <br> <br>
                  To support our wet lab team in a less conceptual way, we also simulated the integration of Cecropin A, one of the most promising binding peptides for the lipid membrane. We could predict in silico, that integration into our lipid batch is possible, at least in principle. This could later be proven by our wet lab team, which actually showed the integration into our chassis in vitro.
