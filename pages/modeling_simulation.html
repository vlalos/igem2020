            Recent developments have hit hard on various people, organisations and projects. Scientists and Universities
            all around the world are subject to said same struggle. Though many questions remain unanswered and problems unsolved,
            it is astounding how quick several rising stars have brought hope to students and staff alike. In times of contact
            restriction our view for the technological augmentations of our professional as well as private lifes has yet been widened.
            Especially, various "Group Meeting Services" hardly want to be missed in the future.

            For the synthetic biology and information science community, one of these technological rising stars has been a tool of
            widespread use for long but was also reserved to highly trained experts, due to its complexity.

            <p>We are proud to say, that iGEM Aachen has taken on the challenge!</p>
            <p>Harnessing the power of various software like <span style="color: #fe336d">CytoScape</span>,
              <span style="color: #2bd792">Chimera</span>, <span style="color: #4f70de">Gromacs</span> and
              <span style="color: #feca40">VMD</span>, we are able to do work fromeverywhere and assist our laboratory team by
              making up for the time they had to hold back!</p>
            <p>Thanks to the months of ongoing training, trial and sweat and tears and error, of our Simulation Subgroup,
              we are in for mastering the molecular dynamics and using its potential to promote and further our research.</p>
            <p><span style="color: #fe336d">M.A.R.S</span> by <span style="color: #2bd792">iGEM Aachen</span> is coming up in big leaps.</p>
            <p>We are proud to share results and experience with you soon! Stay tuned!</p>
