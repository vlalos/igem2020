                enzymes catalyzing them. However, also these enzymes often do not work without the help of certain
                molecules known as cofactors. A very important cofactor is adenosine triphosphate (ATP). Its highly
                energetic phosphate bonds provide the necessary driving force for enzymatic conversion reactions inside
                the cell. This is the reason why ATP is often referred to as the energy currency of cells. It is a
                necessary component of all life.</div>

              <div class=textframe_yellow>We use a previously found approach for ATP regeneration
                where liposomes are equipped with bacteriorhodopsin and ATP synthase to create a chassis-protocell. Together these
                membrane proteins can store the energy of sunlight as chemical energy in the form of ATP.
                In M.A.R.S., this ATP regeneration step is followed by magnetic immobilization of the 
                chassis. Immobilizing them after the ATP regeneration step enables harvesting the ATP while the chassis remain functioning.
                As the immobilization is induced by a magnetic field it can be reversed by turning off this field.
                So, turning off the magnetic field enables another cycle of ATP regeneration.</div>

              has built up the proton gradient by use of light I, in turn, use the proton gradient to covalently bind
              ADP and phosphate to ATP. However, although we originally work together in H. salinarium the version of
