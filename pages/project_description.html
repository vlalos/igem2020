              <div class=textframe_red>A lot of chemical reactions would not be
                possible without enzymes catalyzing them. However, also those enzymes
                often do not work without the help of certain molecules known as cofactors.
                The cofactor which is most frequently needed is Adenosintriphosphate (ATP).
                It carries a high amount of chemical energy directly usable for biochemical
                reactions inside the cell. This is the reason for ATP to often be referred to
                as the energy currency of cells. It is a necessary component of all life.</div>

              <div class=textframe_green>Yes, basically the more ATP the better! But the energy carried by an
                ATP molecule must be invested during its creation from
                Adenosindiphosphate (ADP) and Phosphate. In living organisms this creation
                takes place in the course of cell respiration which is a very complex process
                that cannot be emulated artificially. Thus, ATP needed
                in industrial processes and science has to be created differently. Currently used
                methods consume a lot of resources and the chemical synthesis causes
                avoidable pollution. So, industrial production of ATP is expensive and environmentally harmful so far. </div>

              <div class=textframe_blue>This is the point where our project M.A.R.S. enters the stage. We want
                to improve the current situation by developing a bioreactor capable of cyclic ATP creation.
                The energy needed for this is taken from sunlight and all resources involved are reused in the
                next cycle so that only the basic components of ATP, ADP and Phosphate, need to be provided again.
                This makes ATP production with M.A.R.S. environmentally friendly and much cheaper than previous methods.Â </div>

              <div class=textframe_yellow>We use a previously found approach for ATP regeneration where Liposomes are
                equipped with Bacteriorhodopsin and ATP-Synthase. Together those membrane proteins are able to store the
                energy of sunlight as chemical energy in the form of ATP. In M.A.R.S. this ATP regeneration step is followed
                by magnetic immobilization of the chassis carrying Bacteriorhodopsin and ATP-Synthase. Those chassis are Liposomes
                in the original approach. However, in M.A.R.S. we use Polymersomes. Immobilizing them after the ATP regeneration step
                enables harvesting the ATP while the chassis remain functioning. As the immobilization is induced by a magnetic field
                it can be reversed by turning off this field. So, turning off the magnetic field enables another cycle of ATP regeneration.</div>
