              Our goal is to energize all scientist that create phenomenal processes to tackle various problems humanity faces, like the sustainable and efficient
              production of pharmaceuticals and chemicals. Just like that we want to energize every single person interested in synthetic biology to be able to learn
              more about the science of our project and the general questions, mysteries and ethical concerns coming along with it. <br><br>
              We strongly feel that synthetic biology is often inaccessible to people from all kinds of other backgrounds and yet is nowadays more important than
              ever before.<br><br>
              We wanted to change that. Especially, to convey the science behind our project and to provide a starting point to learn about synthetic biology to every
              person independent on their level of knowledge.<br><br>
              With our concept “Science for everyone” we actively engaged in discourse about all the faces of syn bio and the chances, challenges and responsibilities
              it brings to us as humans. <a href="#newcomers" class="myGreen" style="font-size:16px"><b>Newcomers</b></a>, <a href="#students" class="myBlue" style="font-size:16px"><b>prospective</b></a>

              anyone without a scientific background</b></a>, we brought them closer to an understanding of synthetic biology and our novel ideas and learned a lot from people all over the world in return. Not only about opinions and the impact of science but also about how we can communicate to achieve interest and understanding with mutual respect.

              We had the chance to participate in the podcast ‘Genominal’ of the iGEM Team of Darmstadt and made an episode together with them.
              In this episode we talked about our two projects and the iGEM competition itself.<br><br>
              The podcast aimed to inform everybody without a scientific background about biotechnology and synthetic biology. Two members of the
              team talk about different topics in the episodes and answer various questions. In this special episode we were guests and one member
              of each team were present. We shared funny stories of situations we experienced during the competition.

            <div class="textframe_red container" style="width:100%">
              We were live at the radio station of our university, the RWTH in Aachen. Being interviewed was a chance to use the radio to get closer
              to students of our university. We gave everybody an understanding of our project and synthetic biology. It was an unusual situation.
              After all, the task was to explain in an easy understanding way because everybody could hear the interview. By illustrating the applications
              of our system, we showed how each one of us benefits from M.A.R.S. Our project piqued their interest so much that immediately at the end of
              the interview, we arranged together another session that will take place after the Giant Jamboree to report about the final results.<br><br>

Team Maastricht offered us to do a featured video on
              their youtube channel Geneducation. Geneducation videos are all about explaining iGEM project ideas as well as elementary biological topics for a broad audience. In order to gain more public
              interest in M. A. R. S. we decided to present the idea of our bioreactor.<br><br>
              Therefore, we also gave a short introduction in the functions of ATP and biological energy on a basic level in the first half of the video so we could put across the importance of our project
              idea for people of non-biological background.<br><br>

               Educating people of various backgrounds, especially spreading the knowledge to people with low access to scientific world is one of the aspects we wanted to focus on.<br><br>
               Learning the list of participated countries in iGEM, we noticed that such regions as Central Asia or Africa are poorly informed of what iGEM is and how students could battle the ongoing global
               problems by coming up with their innovative ideas.<br><br>
               <img src="https://2020.igem.org/wiki/images/7/70/T--Aachen--Uz_on_globe.png" style="float: left; shape-outside: circle(50%); width: 25%; margin:10px">
               Uzbekistan is a country of a particular interest for us. Learning more about the climate change at school, the problem of Aral Sea was always mentioned. We wanted to focus on Uzbek students and
               help them open their potential and enhance the research competence. Creating projects to solve the problem of Aral Sea and to level up the innovation level in that region in general, iGEM is the
               right springboard for that.<br><br>
               The cooperation with the Embassy of the Federal Republic of Germany in Uzbekistan (Tashkent), Goethe Institute Tashkent, the German Academic Exchange Service and the World Association of Youth in
               Uzbekistan gave us a platform to show our impact on a sustainable future world and to motivate young Uzbek students to run more such projects, to build connections internationally and maybe even
               step up as the first iGEM team from Uzbekistan.<br><br>

               The meeting lasted for about two hours. In this time, we explained what iGEM is, showed the potential of Biotechnology based on the example of one of our team member’s research project in the field
               of cancer stem cells, highlighted the importance of the participation in various research competitions worldwide and explained the science behind our project. Later we had a discussion round and
               could answer all the questions not only concerning our idea, but also about what personal skills are required for such projects; how to raise money to finance the idea; the comparison of a student
               life between Uzbekistan and Germany as well as the importance of improvement of intercultural competence.<br><br>
               Lastly, we got a lot of positive feedback from the participants and a huge appreciation from the above-mentioned organizations.<br><br>

               and iGEM as well as our project. The students were very interested in the structure of our team and how it works together with the competition. We explained the importance of relying
               on each other and that everybody should give their best to full fill together the tasks of the team. Especially we pointed out that every single team member has its own exceptional
               abilities and that everybody can contribute to such a project. Through the interdisciplinary nature of our team we could show that no matter what you study you can be part of an iGEM team.<br><br>

               Apart from that we presented the importance of the molecule ATP, which was only known as a molecule in metabolic pathways. Connected to our project and the idea of it we were able to illustrated

               The btS, which is short for “biotechnologische Studenteninitiative” (biotechnological student initiative),  is a Life Science student initiative from Germany. Once a year the Aachen
               group of btS publishes a science guide. It introduces local scientific groups and their work to interested people from the field of biology and biotechnology. For this year’s edition
               we wrote an article about the iGEM competion and the history of Teams from Aachen participating in it. By doing so, we introduced iGEM to commited young scientists.<br><br><br>

                <b>English version of the text:</b><br><br>

                The "international Genetically Engineered Machines" Competition, iGEM Competition for short, is an international student competition in the field of synthetic biology.
                It has its roots in a course held at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) in 2003, which aimed to make biological systems usable in a context other than the natural one.
                This same goal is still the focus of the annual competition, which now attracts more than 350 teams from over 40 countries. Since 2014, one of them is a team from RWTH Aachen University,
                which is supported by Prof. Dr. Wolfgang Wiechert, Prof. Dr. Ulrich Schwaneberg and Prof. Dr. Lars Blank.<br>
                The members of the participating teams are mainly students of life sciences and biotechnology. However, students of other natural sciences or engineering disciplines are also among the
                participants. In this interdisciplinary environment, the teams have about one semester to develop a project idea and implement it in the laboratory. The results are documented on the team's
                own website during the semester and presented to the other teams and the expert jury at final presentations in Boston at the end of October each year.<br>
                In addition to the actual work on the project, the teams have to cooperate with other teams, organize meetings, do public relations work, and take care of the organization for the daily laboratory routine, ordering laboratory utensils and raising funds. Furthermore, the theoretical modeling of the project as well as the creation of a hardware appropriate to the project is desired. The Aachen teams have mastered all these challenges with flying colors so far, which has already earned them several nominations, prizes and a gold medal every year.

               Every autumn the student council for Life Sciences publishes an information brochure for the freshman students starting their studies in Biology or Biotechnology at RWTH Aachen University.
               As it is very important for us as a iGEM team to spread awareness about the possibilities synthetic biology offers, we gladly accepted their invitation for writing a short article about the iGEM
               competition in general and our team in particular. Their goal here was to introduce student initiatives to the freshmen so that they learn where they can get involved during their studies.
               For us this meant to have the chance to introduce iGEM to freshmen students who will hopefully continue the work of iGEM Aachen in the future.
               Unfortunately, the introductory event for the new students will not take place this year due to the corona-pandemic. Therefore, the brochure will not be printed this year but made available online
               via the platform RWTHmoodle. Our text can be found there in the section "Erstikrams" (German for "stuff for freshmen") in the pdf document "Vorstellung der Eigeninitiativen", which means "presentation of the initiatives".<br>

               by using biological systems outside their natural context.<br>

               Schwaneberg and Prof. Wiechert, the iGEM team from Aachen has won a gold medal every year so far. For this purpose, besides the development and execution of the project idea, other aspects such
               as public relations, meetings with other teams and expert discussions have to be organized. In addition, the teams themselves are responsible for documenting the work and raising the necessary
               funds. Please visit our website igem.rwth-aachen.de to learn more about us and the competition.<br>

               Around December each year the current Aachen iGEM team recruits a new one. We would be happy if you would join us soon.

               A good breakfast provides us with the necessary energy in the morning - likewise most small molecular machines need a source of energy to work adequately. The universal energy source
               adeno-sintriphosphate (ATP) is an important co-factor in this respect and with its high-energy phosphate bonds provides the necessary driving force for enzymatic conversion reactions. In cells
               of living organisms, regeneration takes place via various metabolic pathways. However, when exporting conversion reactions into an isolated and product-oriented process, the said regeneration
               via cell-internal metabolic pathways is currently both uneconomical and ineffective. Nevertheless, we have chosen this enzyme system because this approach offers immense advantages: The work with
               immobilized enzymes not only allows a more targeted reaction process through high-purity product yield, selective enantiomeric purity and hardly any side reactions, but also an environmentally
               friendly process approach: Our goal is to overcome the above mentioned hurdles and to establish an innovative method for the synthetic recycling of ATP with M.A.R.S., the magnetic ATP-recycling
               system. With the support of Lars Blank, Ulrich Schwaneberg and Wolgang Wiechert as well as their teams from the RWTH Aachen University and the Forschungszentrum Jülich, the team is creating an
               artificial power plant in the form of a proto-cell, which is modelled on the mitochondrium, in a bottom-up approach. This chassis generates a proton gradient across its membrane by means of the
               inwardly directed, light-driven proton pump Bacteriorhodopsin, so that the ATP synthase, which is also installed, can use this gradient for the synthesis of ATP. The binding of the chassis to
               magnetic particles by means of linker peptides allows reuse by magnetic separation in a specially created reactor. iGEM relies on extensive collaborations with other iGEM teams and experts in the
               field to ensure a broad social and professional exchange despite - or perhaps because of - corona.
