               Additionally, to the <a class="myGreen" href="#CostaRicaUniversity">meeting with students of a Costa Rican university</a> we met around 30 pupils of a Costa Rican school. In this meeting we wanted to spread the idea of biotechnology
               and iGEM as well as our project. The students were very interested in the structure of our team and how it works together with the competition. We explained the importance of relying
               on each other and that everybody should give their best to full fill together the tasks of the team. Especially we pointed out that every single team member has its own exceptional
               abilities and that everybody can contribute to such a project. Through the interdisciplinary nature of our team we could show that no matter what you study you can be part of an iGEM team.<br><br>
               Apart from that we presented the importance of the molecule ATP, which was only known as a molecule in metabolic pathways. Connected to our project and the idea of it we were able to illustrated
               that it can be used in many industrial processes.

               To spread the idea of iGEM and our project into the world we organized an online meeting with interested students of the ‘Universidad de Costa Rica’.
               Around 40 students of the pharmacy career were present at the meeting. We had the chance to present our project and the idea of iGEM to a different
               audience. After the presentation we had a long discussion with the students. They gave us the chance to see our project in a different way because
               they come from a different field of research. Through their specific questions, which came especially form the medical background, we had the opportunity
               to explain how our M.A.R.S. can help to improve the production of precursors of pharmaceuticals. They gave us a deep understanding of the importance of
               ATP in their field of research. Furthermore, it showed the validation of the importance of our system and that not only in our plan but also in reality our
               system is needed more than before.<br><br>
               Apart from our project itself, we saw the priority of spreading the idea of such a chance to change the world and make it a better place because it
               became very clear that all of them also would appreciate it to be part of an iGEM team and the iGEM competition. At the end of the meeting we got a
               lot of questions concerning the procedure of becoming an iGEM member.

               The btS, which is short for “biotechnologische Studenteninitiative” (biotechnological student initiative),  is a Life Science student initiative from Germany. Once a year the Aachen
               group of btS publishes a science guide. It introduces local scientific groups and their work to interested people from the field of biology and biotechnology. For this year’s edition
               we wrote an article about the iGEM competion and the history of Teams from Aachen participating in it. By doing so, we introduced iGEM to commited young scientists.<br><br><br>

                The "international Genetically Engineered Machines" Competition, iGEM Competition for short, is an international student competition in the field of synthetic biology.
                It has its roots in a course held at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) in 2003, which aimed to make biological systems usable in a context other than the natural one.
                This same goal is still the focus of the annual competition, which now attracts more than 350 teams from over 40 countries. Since 2014, one of them is a team from RWTH Aachen University,
                which is supported by Prof. Dr. Wolfgang Wiechert, Prof. Dr. Ulrich Schwaneberg and Prof. Dr. Lars Blank.<br>
                The members of the participating teams are mainly students of life sciences and biotechnology. However, students of other natural sciences or engineering disciplines are also among the
                participants. In this interdisciplinary environment, the teams have about one semester to develop a project idea and implement it in the laboratory. The results are documented on the team's
                own website during the semester and presented to the other teams and the expert jury at final presentations in Boston at the end of October each year.<br>
                In addition to the actual work on the project, the teams have to cooperate with other teams, organize meetings, do public relations work, and take care of the organization for the daily laboratory routine, ordering laboratory utensils and raising funds. Furthermore, the theoretical modeling of the project as well as the creation of a hardware appropriate to the project is desired. The Aachen teams have mastered all these challenges with flying colors so far, which has already earned them several nominations, prizes and a gold medal every year.

               As it is very important for us as a iGEM team to spread awareness about the possibilities synthetic biology offers, we gladly accepted their invitation for writing a short article about the iGEM
               competition in general and our team in particular. This gave us the chance to introduce iGEM to freshmen students who will hopefully continue the work of iGEM Aachen in the future.<br><br><br>

                Since 2014, the iGEM Team Aachen takes part in the "international Genetically Engineered Machine" competition, in short iGEM competition. This is an international student competition in synthetic
                biology, in which interdisciplinary teams from all over the world work for one semester on self-chosen projects. The goal of these projects is to solve medical, industrial or environmental problems
                by using biological systems outside their natural context.<br>

                The results of the projects are presented to the other teams and a scientific jury at the final event, the Giant Jamboree, at the end of October each year. With the support of Prof. Blank, Prof.
                Schwaneberg and Prof. Wiechert, the iGEM team from Aachen has won a gold medal every year so far. For this purpose, besides the development and execution of the project idea, other aspects such
                as public relations, meetings with other teams and expert discussions have to be organized. In addition, the teams themselves are responsible for documenting the work and raising the necessary
                funds. Please visit our website igem.rwth-aachen.de to learn more about us and the competition.<br>

                Around December each year the current Aachen iGEM team recruits a new one. We would be happy if you would join us soon.

              The journal BIOspektrum, which is the publication organ of the Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology (GBM), the Association for General and Applied Microbiology (VAAM), the Society for
              Genetics (GfG) and the German Society for Experimental and Clinical Pharmacology and Toxicology (DGPT), reaches around 15,000 readers through a wide range of information. The publication of an

               A good breakfast provides us with the necessary energy in the morning - likewise most small molecular machines need a source of energy to work adequately. The universal energy source
               adeno-sintriphosphate (ATP) is an important co-factor in this respect and with its high-energy phosphate bonds provides the necessary driving force for enzymatic conversion reactions. In cells
               of living organisms, regeneration takes place via various metabolic pathways. However, when exporting conversion reactions into an isolated and product-oriented process, the said regeneration
               via cell-internal metabolic pathways is currently both uneconomical and ineffective. Nevertheless, we have chosen this enzyme system because this approach offers immense advantages: The work with
               immobilized enzymes not only allows a more targeted reaction process through high-purity product yield, selective enantiomeric purity and hardly any side reactions, but also an environmentally
               friendly process approach: Our goal is to overcome the above mentioned hurdles and to establish an innovative method for the synthetic recycling of ATP with M.A.R.S., the magnetic ATP-recycling
               system. With the support of Lars Blank, Ulrich Schwaneberg and Wolgang Wiechert as well as their teams from the RWTH Aachen University and the Forschungszentrum Jülich, the team is creating an
               artificial power plant in the form of a proto-cell, which is modelled on the mitochondrium, in a bottom-up approach. This chassis generates a proton gradient across its membrane by means of the
               inwardly directed, light-driven proton pump Bacteriorhodopsin, so that the ATP synthase, which is also installed, can use this gradient for the synthesis of ATP. The binding of the chassis to
               magnetic particles by means of linker peptides allows reuse by magnetic separation in a specially created reactor. iGEM relies on extensive collaborations with other iGEM teams and experts in the
               field to ensure a broad social and professional exchange despite - or perhaps because of - corona.
