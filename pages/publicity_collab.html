              Strengthening the iGEM community is one of our values. We want to energize everyone to grow with and to learn from one another.
              We think that Intercultural exchange helps us to improve ourselves and to be a part of an inclusive culture. Therefore, we cooperated
              with iGEM teams from every corner of the world. As students it is vital for us to take part in building bridges between teams and people
              across the globe, while also energizing others to do the same.<br><br>

              Together with iGEM Marburg and various other Teams from all around the World we were part of the “German iGEM Online Meetup”, an interactive Zoom meeting over the course of
              2 days. We attended many interesting workshops, for example about Biosecurity by Team Bielefeld and Bioinformatics by Team Moscow. The highlight of the Meetup was the poster
              session. We participated by designing and presenting a project overview poster about our M.A.R.S. – Bioreactor. When designing the poster in June our system was still called
              “Regeneration System” rather than “Recycling System”. We received great feedback for our poster and on top of that, we had the chance to answer a lot of interesting questions
              from all the participants, training us in giving spontaneous yet detailed answers in front of a scientific audience. Of course, we also enjoyed seeing the posters of other
              teams and asking our many follow-up questions as well.<br><br>

              iGEM – a platform not only to run your own project, but also to connect with other peers from around the world. But in times of a pandemic, it is almost impossible.
              With all the restrictions, levels of stress, loneliness and anxiety rose. And this is when the iGEM teams, as future scientists, need to step up with an action.

              Our small contribution to making daily life of iGEM participants a little brighter, we were one of the first teams initiated an international collaboration.
              Tying the knot of friendship with other teams is one of our goals. In the cooperation with the iGEM Team Darmstadt we were able to come up with a creative video
              named “iJET” hiding a very important message – connecting, bringing us closer together and showing that we all share the same sky. The small paperplane created in
              Germany flew around the world and reached 27 iGEM teams internationally. <br><br>

              As every year the iGEM team of the Heinrich Heine University Düsseldorf organized the iGEM postcard challenge. This was one of the first collaborations we participated in.
              Because of the lack of direct interactions of teams this year, we were especially enthusiastic about the upcoming collaborations over longer distances via the Internet and by post.
              The task in this collaboration was to design a postcard and to send 50 copies of it to Düsseldorf. In return, we would receive postcards from other participating iGEM teams.
              The designed postcard should show something related to our project or synthetic biology in general. We decided that our postcard should show a self-drawn cartoon-like
              visualisation of the chassis in our bioreactor, which are the heart of our project.For our efforts, we received 30 wonderful postcards from different iGEM teams.<br><br>
              This collaboration was a nice alternation as we needed to become creative.

              A few weeks after we had sent 50 copies of a <a href="#postcard" class="myYell">self created postcard</a> to iGEM Düsseldorf, the team contacted us again asking whether we would be interested in participating in
              another collaboration with them. This time the goal was to show the friendship between iGEM Teams from different countries by just one picture containing the mascots of these teams.
              We loved this idea of because friendly cooperations inside an iGEM team and between iGEM teams is essential to reach the individual goals. So we sent them our marsian traveling in its
              magnetic space ship M.A.R.S. regenerating ATP from ADP and Phosphate. Also the teams IISER Bhopal and iGEM Stockholm sent in their mascot. Having everything together iGEM Düsseldorf
              could create this beautiful and lovable little picture you see on the right.   It was posted on Instagram on the 30th of July, the international day of friendship.

                The iGEM Team MSP Maastricht reached out to us and asked whether we would be interested in participating in their Covid19-Video-Collaboration with iGEM Nantes.
                We gladly accepted this invitation and directly started discussing how we experienced the corona-pandemic during our project.<br><br>
                The collaboration aimed at creating videos in which all three teams describe how the corona-pandemic influenced their work. This description should be based on nine questions which
                were already chosen by the other two iGEM teams. However, we liked those questions a lot and were curious to get the answers to them from iGEM Nantes and iGEM MSP Maastricht. <br><br>
                We filmed our videos in front of the Elisenbrunnen in Aachen and sent them to the MSP iGEM Team in the beginning of August. Together with those videos we sent our
                project logo as well as pictures of us writing the first three questions down. This footage was taken to create the intro sequence of the first collaboration video.
                The post-production of all three videos was done by MSP iGEM.<br><br>
                We really like the result of this collaboration which are three videos giving a good overview of the impact the Corona pandemic had on three different iGEM teams.<br><br>
                It was incredibly interesting to see how different the situation developed for iGEM teams in different countries.

              Pandemic – one virus, millions of lives. This is an exceptional year for all of us. But exactly in such times we need to show our strength, flexibility and knowledge. Following all
              the safety regulations, we could organize three productive meet-ups with iGEM Team MSP Maastricht.<br><br>
              As the corona regulations started loosening, our team decided to deepen the roots of international collaboration. Maastricht, located in the Netherlands, is about 18 miles away from
              Aachen and thus the most suitable team for the first meeting in person. Since we can’t fly around the European countries and organize a physical interaction with other teams, going to
              the Netherlands by train was therefore something special for us. We were able to not only present our projects to one another, get feedbacks and discuss the challenges we face in the
              laboratories, but also to strengthen our team spirit by attending a city tour. Our schedule was very tight. We had a chance to be involved in the Geneducation youtube channel of iGEM
              MSP Maastricht and film about the science behind our project. If we should have described our meeting in just one word, that would be obvious – productivity. Because we tried to not
              only focus on our projects, but also to get three presentations by doctoral and post-doctoral students from the Forschungszentrum Jülich:<br><br>

              as well as organize few-hours-long teambuilding by playing games that could boost our marketing skills, enhance our team spirit, and develop other personal skills.<br><br>

              We collaborated with the iGEM Team of MSP Maastricht again a few weeks after our <a class="myRed" href="#MSP1">first Meet-Up</a>. Whilst the previous Meeting was centred on improving presenting
              and improving our project ideas and lab work, we set “Human Practices” and “Science Communication” as the focus of this collaboration. Before we started with the work, we showed Team
              MSP the city of Aachen with a fun rally, where our teams had to solve small tasks in mixed groups and in front of Aachen’s most prominent sights.<br><br>
              Both of our teams are heavily involved in many projects from these categories. It is a common goal of our teams to not only participate in the scientific process, but to also make it
              accessible to larger groups of people with various levels of background knowledge. We quickly discovered two possible approaches to achieve this goal: Spreading awareness about our
              project and its impacts on the world and informing about the basic principles, practices and morals of synthetic biology.<br><br>
              A combination of both proved to be the best way to consistently create interesting and meaningful discourse with others in the field or the public. Team MSP had a lot of projects in
              human practices, for example their great “Proceedings Journal” initiative. Our Team was more prominent in the science communication so we could benefit from each other’s experiences.
              Also, it was just a lot of fun to talk about the challenges, results and takeaways we had from our previous work in HP and Science-Communication.

              We collaborated with Team Nantes via Zoom to share our project ideas and receive feedback for our concepts and used methods. Team Nantes is one of the few teams whose
              ultimate goal is the creation of a bioreactor. Just like we do with our M.A.R.S. – Bioreactor. Team Nantes tries to tackle the problem of algae formation by fermenting
              engineered E.coli in their reactor. While they try to emulate a stirred tank production fermenter, our system is much smaller and based on a 3D-printed shake reactor
              which enables us to incorporate our magnetic mechanism properly. We shared a lot of insights and the challenges we faced in bioreactor design to help each other to see
              their engineering from a different point of view.
