              Initiated by <a class="myYell" href="https://2020.igem.org/Team:Marburg">iGEM Marburg</a><br><br>
              We collaborated with iGEM Marburg and various other Teams from all around the World to be part of the “German iGEM Online Meetup”,
              an interactive Zoom Meting over the course of 2 days, where we attended some interesting workshops, for example about Biosecurity by
              Team Bielefeld and Bioinformatics by Team Moscow. The highlight of the Meetup was the poster session. We participated by designing and
              presenting a project overview poster for our M.A.R.S. – Bioreactor. When designing the poster in June our system was still called
              “Regeneration System” rather than “Recycling System”. We received great feedback for our poster and on top of that got to answer a lot of
              interesting question by all the participants, causing us to train giving spontaneous but yet detailed questions in front of a scientific
              audience. Of course, we stayed to see the posters of other teams and asked our many follow-up questions, too.

              iGEM – a platform not only to run your own project, but also to connect with other peers from around the world. But in times of a pandemic,
              it is almost impossible. COVID-19 challenged the whole humanity by restricting the physical contact, cancelling plenty of activities and affecting
              daily routines. With all the safety regulations levels of stress, loneliness and anxiety rose <a style="color: #eaeaea" href="#ref1"><b>[1]</b></a>.
              And this is when the iGEM teams, as future scientists, need to step up with an action.<br><br>

              Our small contribution to making daily life of iGEM participants a little brighter, we were one of the first teams initiated an international collaboration.
              Tying the knot of friendship with other teams is one of our goals. In the cooperation with the iGEM Team Darmstadt we were able to come up with a creative video
              named “iJET” hiding very important message – connecting, bringing us closer
              together and showing that we all share the same sky. The small paperplane created in Germany flew around the world and reached almost 30 iGEM teams internationally.<br><br>

              Initiated by <a class="myYell" href="https://2020.igem.org/Team:Duesseldorf">iGEM Düsseldorf</a><br><br>
              As every year the iGEM team of the Heinrich Heine University Düsseldorf organized the iGEM postcard challenge. This was one of the first collaborations we participated in.
              Because of the lack of direct interactions of teams this year, we were especially enthusiastic about the upcoming challenges. The task was to design a postcard and to send
              50 copies of it to Düsseldorf. In return, we would receive postcards from other participating iGEM teams. The designed postcard should show something related to our project
              or synthetic biology in general. On the postcard we designed we were trying to show a cartoon-like visualisation the chassis in our bioreactor, the heart of our project.
              This collaboration was a nice alternation as we needed to become creative.

              The iGEM Team MSP Maastricht reached out to us and asked whether we would be interested in participating in their Covid19-Video-Collaboration with iGEM Nantes.
              We gladly accepted this invitation and directly started discussing how we experienced the corona-pandemic during our project.<br><br>
              The collaboration aimed at creating videos in which all three teams describe how the corona-pandemic influenced their work. This descsription should
              be based on 9 questions which were already chosen by the other two iGEM teams. However, we liked them a lot and were curious to get the answers to them.<br><br>
              We filmed our videos in front of the Elisenbrunnen in Aachen and sent them to the MSP iGEM Team in the beginning of August. Together with those videos we sent our
              project logo as well as pictures of us writing the first three questions down. This footage was taken to create the intro sequence of the first collaboration video.
              The post-production of all three videos was done by MSP iGEM.<br><br>
              We really like the result of this collaboration which are three videos giving a good overview of the impact the Corona pandemic had on three different iGEM teams.
               The videos can be found on YouTube: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YneoWiUDVvg" class="myRed" style="font-size:16px"><b>Part 1</b></a>,
               <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahgkifRsFbs" class="myRed" style="font-size:16px"><b>Part 2</b></a> and <a href="#" class="myRed" style="font-size:16px"><b>Part 3</b></a>.
              It was incredibly interesting to see how different the situation developed for iGEM teams in different countries.

              Pandemic – one virus, millions of lives. This is an exceptional year for all of us. But exactly in such times we need to show our strength, flexibility and knowledge. Following all
              the safety regulations, we could organize three productive meet-ups with iGEM Team MSP Maastricht.<br><br>
              As the corona regulations started loosening, our team decided to deepen the roots of international collaboration. Maastricht, located in the Netherlands, is about 18 miles away from
              Aachen and thus the most suitable team for the first meeting in person. Since we can’t fly around the European countries and organize a physical interaction with other teams, going to
              the Netherlands by train was therefore something special for us. We were able to not only present our projects to one another, get feedbacks and discuss the challenges we face in the
              laboratories, but also to strengthen our team spirit by attending a city tour. Our schedule was very tight. We had a chance to be involved in the Geneducation youtube channel of iGEM
              MSP Maastricht and film about the science behind our project. If we should have described our meeting in just one word, that would be obvious – productivity. Because we tried to not
              only focus on our projects, but also to get three presentations by doctoral and post-doctoral students from the Forschungszentrum Jülich:<br><br>

              We collaborated with the Team of MSP Maastricht again a few weeks after our first Meet-Up. Whilst the previous Meeting was centred on improving presenting
              and improving our project ideas and lab work, we set “Human Practices” and “Science Communication” as the focus of this collaboration. Before we started with the work, we showed Team
              MSP the city of Aachen with a fun rally, where our teams had to solve small tasks in mixed groups and in front of Aachen’s most prominent sights.<br><br>
              Both of our teams are heavily involved in many projects from these categories. It is a common goal of our teams to not only participate in the scientific process, but to also make it
              accessible to larger groups of people with various levels of background knowledge. We quickly discovered two possible approaches to achieve this goal: Spreading awareness about our
              project and its impacts on the world and informing about the basic principles, practices and morals of synthetic biology.<br><br>
              A combination of both proved to be the best way to consistently create interesting and meaningful discourse with others in the field or the public. Team MSP had a lot of projects in
              human practices, for example their great “Proceedings Journal” initiative. Our Team was more prominent in the science communication so we could benefit from each other’s experiences.
              Also, it was just a lot of fun to talk about the challenges, results and takeaways we had from our previous work in HP and Science-Communication.

              We collaborated with Team Nantes via Zoom to share our project ideas and receive feedback for our concepts and used methods. Team Nantes is one of the few teams whose
              ultimate goal is the creation of a bioreactor. Just like we do with our M.A.R.S. – Bioreactor. Team Nantes tries to tackle the problem of algae formation by fermenting
              engineered E.coli in their reactor. While they try to emulate a stirred tank production fermenter, our system is much smaller and based on a 3D-printed shake reactor
              which enables us to incorporate our magnetic mechanism properly. We shared a lot of insights and the challenges we faced in bioreactor design to help each other to see
              their engineering from a different point of view.
