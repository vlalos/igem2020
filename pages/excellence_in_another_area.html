              Over the course of 9 hours we worked on developing sophisticated point-of-care microfluidic quick tests for the SARS-CoV-2. First, we had some introductory lectures on
              the necessary topics and backgrounds, held by some team members. We started with recapitulating the biology and genomics of the SARS-CoV-2 and looked at existing methods
              used in testing, from PCR to ELISA approaches. It was very important for us to focus on the feasibility and the point-of-care aspect of our concepts, to achieve quick
              reliable test results just from the concentration found in the spit of an infected person. Our goal was to reduce the necessary lab equipment and trained professionals
              needed to perform the tests, to broaden application and simplifying the whole process. We learned to work with the free to use CAD software “Fusion360” to be able to create
              our microchip concepts in form of a 3D Modell. In combination with a lecture on the differential calculus and programming of electrical heating and pumping systems with
              “Arduino-gadgets” we were equipped perfectly to start the brainstorming and development phase of our Hackathon. We worked in groups of three, where each team had students
              of different fields to enrich the creation process. After 9 long hours we had 5 completed concepts of novel detection mechanisms for the coronavirus that could work in a
              point-of-care matter. Two systems used microchips in combination with different measurement techniques for the virus’s RNA. One team developed a high-sensitivity ELISA
              approach to detect the viruses spike-proteins inside of a microchip. Another team used a completely different approach, incorporating a Sandwich-ELISA onto the surface
              of a wearable face mask. The fifth concept, created by a team with two physicists used an adsorbent capture technique inside a microchip to then detect the amount of bound
              virus particles by surface plasmon resonance.
