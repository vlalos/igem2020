            The Bioaccelerator is a place for students from different scientific and engineering backgrounds to meet and collaborate. While the Accelerator is centered around the laboratory space, it combines it with automatization technology and artificial intelligence. We encourage our teams to be at the bleeding edge of the next bio-cyber-physical systems. The start of our batch #0 was the hackathon with the MSP team to develop a fast, cheap and reliable point-of-care test system for COVID19. The hackathon spurred some teams to continue to work on their system.

              Inspired by iGEM, we are committed to democratize synthetic biology. Typical study programs in biology and biotechnology contain around 3 to 6
              months of labtime over the course of the whole bachelors. This is not enough time to develop elite levels of lab performance. This performance
              is necessary to effectively further synthetic biology. More over the time spend in labs is exclusively spend on predefined protocols and papers.
              While it is necessary to learn the fundamental skills of lab work, it does not equip the students with the vital skills of critically questioning
              the decisions of the protocols. It discourages to creatively ponder/think about problems. It also doesn’t account for the personal preferences of
              each student. Countless research shows that working on a self-defined project a student is passionate about, is a blessing for learning and remembering
              problems.

              The BioAccelerator solves these problems. The BioAccelerator gives students a place to work on their ideas. Embedded into the Excellent Startup
              Center of the RWTH, it’s goal is to give the students an infrastructure from start to scaleup. We want to combine lab space together with an
              infrastructure build for artificial intelligence as well as proximity to a maker space for mechanical and electrical engineering. This way we can
              leverage the whole process of developing a synbio project. Accompanied with bootcamps in entrepreneurship it equips students to quickly develop a
              project, bringing it to market and scaling it.

              The major obstacle for the BioAccelerator is getting funding for the equipment personell and chemicals. We need to acquire
              multiple sources of funding from different investors. While making it more probable to acquire enough funding, it makes the
              whole process a lot more challenging, given that different investors have different expectations and investment horizons.

            We will be part of the Excellent Startup Center of the RWTH. This gives us several key advantages. First we reduced a significant
            recurring cost as we don’t have to pay rent. While this in itself is a significant benefit it also puts us into proximity to other
            founder’s, which will have a significant influence for the general culture for our lab. Integral part of the Excellent Startup Center
            is a maker space with machines and equipment for mechanical and electrical engineering.

              For our third meet-up with the iGEM Team MSP-Maastricht we organized a “Covid-19 Hackathon”. In the face of the current pandemic, Covid-19 left no part of all our
              lives untouched. The same is true for the iGEM competition. We felt the urge to direct some of our collective abilities and ideas towards solutions for the current situation.<br><br>
              Over the course of nine hours we worked on developing sophisticated point-of-care microfluidic quick tests for the SARS-CoV-2. First, we had some introductory lectures on the necessary
              topics and backgrounds, held by some team members. We started with recapitulating the biology and genomics of the SARS-CoV-2 and looked at existing methods used in testing, from PCR
              to ELISA approaches. It was very important for us to focus on the feasibility and the point-of-care aspect of our concepts, to achieve quick reliable test results just from the
              concentration found in the spit of an infected person. Our goal was to reduce the necessary lab equipment and trained professionals needed to perform the tests, to broaden application
              and simplifying the whole process. We learned to work with the free to use CAD software “Fusion360” to be able to create our microchip concepts in form of a 3D Modell. In combination
              with a lecture on the differential calculus and programming of electrical heating and pumping systems with “Arduino-gadgets” we were equipped perfectly to start the brainstorming and
              development phase of our Hackathon. We worked in groups of three, where each team had students of different fields to enrich the creation process.

              After 9 long hours we had 5 completed
              concepts of novel detection mechanisms for the coronavirus that could work in a point-of-care matter. Two systems used microchips in combination with different measurement techniques
              for the virus’s RNA. One team developed a high-sensitivity ELISA approach to detect the viruses spike-proteins inside of a microchip. Another team used a completely different approach,
              incorporating a Sandwich-ELISA onto the surface of a wearable face mask. The fifth concept, created by a team with two physicists used an adsorbent capture technique inside a microchip
              to then detect the amount of bound virus particles by surface plasmon resonance.
